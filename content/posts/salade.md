## Problem statement

{{< figure src="/images/salade-de-fruits.png" >}}

## Curve isomorphism

This is a classic problem of **cubic equation**, it turns out that every cubic equation (that is not degenerate) is isomorphic to an **elliptic curve**, `Sagemath` has a conveniant function for that, so let's quickly look at the isomorphism (and its inverse function) :

```python
P = QQ["p, s, b"]
p, s, b = P.gens()

eq = p ** 3 - 94 * b ** 3 + s ** 3

f = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(eq)
print(f)
fi = f.inverse()
print(fi)
```

we get :

```txt
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by p^3 + s^3 - 94*b^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 846*y = x^3 - 238572 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (p : s : b) to
        (-b : -3*p : -1/282*p - 1/282*s)
Scheme morphism:
  From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 846*y = x^3 - 238572 over Rational Field
  To:   Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by p^3 + s^3 - 94*b^3
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (-1/3*y : 1/3*y - 282*z : -x)
```

## Solving the whole challenge

We want a solution with :

- $ 1 \le p$
- $ 1 \le s \le p$
- $ 1 \le b \le p$

We know its *easy* to find and iterate over points on an elliptic curve which by isomorphism will correspond to solutions of the equation, but we have to deal with the constraints...

Well, I just iterated from a generator of the curve until I found a solution with the constrains, not sure if it would work in the general case but it's always good to try your first idea and see what comes next, I was lucky and that was an immediate flag.

And because we're working in the projective plane normalized in $Z$ for elliptic curves, we have to bring back the solution from $\mathbb Q$ to $\mathbb Z$ which is done by multiplying $p_s$ and $s_s$ by their corresponding lcm.

```python
from sage.all import *
from itertools import count
from hashlib import sha256

P = QQ["p, s, b"]
p, s, b = P.gens()
eq = p ** 3 - 94 * b ** 3 + s ** 3

f = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(eq)
fi = f.inverse()

E = f.codomain()
G = E.gen(0)

for i in count(start = 1):
    ps, ss, bs = fi(i*G)
    if (ps > 0 and ss > 0 and bs > 0):
        y = lcm(ps.denom(), ss.denom())
        ps *= y
        ss *= y
        bs *= y

        h = sha256(str(bs).encode()).hexdigest()

        print(f"FCSC{{{h}}}")
        exit()
```
